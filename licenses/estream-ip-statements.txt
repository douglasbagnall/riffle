Grain
+++++
      The Grain stream cipher is Copyright © 2005, Martin Hell, Thomas
      Johansson and Willi Meier. The Grain cipher is not based on any
      licence or patents.

      We hereby grant anybody licence to use, copy, modify or
      distribute the Grain cipher under the following terms:

          * You may not license or patent any intellectual work and/or
            product based on a copy or a modification of the Grain
            cipher. You may include the Grain cipher in a licensed or
            patented product but the Grain cipher must then be
            excluded from the license or patent in question.


          * The copyright holders are not legally responsible for any
            damage caused by the use of any product based on the Grain
            cipher.

          * You may not use, copy, modify, or distribute the Grain
            cipher except as expressly provided under this
            license. Any attempt otherwise to use, copy, modify or
            distribute the Grain cipher is void, and will
            automatically terminate your rights under this license.

      This license can only be made void by the copyright holders and
      the ECRYPT NoE committee in agreement with the copyright
      holders.

      The authors also undertake the task to update the Grain cipher
      as required by the ECRYPT NoE committee.

      (The IPR statement also applies to Grain v1 and Grain-128).

HC
++
      The stream ciphers HC-128 and HC-256 are not patented and are
      royalty free. Anyone can use HC-128 and HC-256 free of
      charge. And I would like to update the ECRYPT Stream Cipher
      project when necessary.

Rabbit
++++++
      Rabbit was released in late 2008 into the public domain by
      Cryptico A/S (the company that designed the stream cipher), and
      may be used freely for any purpose. See here.

Salsa20
+++++++
      My policy is that Salsa20 is free for everyone to use. I am not
      aware of any patents or patent applications covering Salsa20. I
      will update the ECRYPT Stream Cipher project when necessary.

SOSEMANUK
+++++++++
      The Sosemanuk cipher and the provided reference implementations
      are knowledge arising from a joint work carried out under the
      X-CRYPT Project, supported by the Ministère de l'éducation
      Nationale, de la Recherche et de la Technologie, France. Thus,
      Axalto S.A., France Télécom, Cryptolog International, the
      Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en
      Automatique, the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,
      the Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines and the
      École Normale Supérieure have joint ownership of the Sosemanuk
      cipher and its reference implementations.

      To our knowledge, the Sosemanuk cipher is not based on any
      licensed, patented or otherwise legally restricted existing
      work. The inventors of Sosemanuk wish that the Sosemanuk cipher
      and the provided reference implementations are and remain freely
      available, and may be used by anyone for any purpose, including
      commercial exploitation, without restriction. In particular, the
      inventors did not --­ and do not intend to --­ license, patent
      or otherwise restrict neither the Sosemanuk algorithm, nor any
      part of it, nor any implementation of it.

      The inventors also undertake the task to update the Sosemanuk
      cipher as required by the ECRYPT Stream cipher project when
      necessary.

Trivium
+++++++
      To the author's knowledge Trivium is not covered by any
      patent. Trivium is also free available for any use.
